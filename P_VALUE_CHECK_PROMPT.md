# P-Value Verification Prompt

## Context
We're analyzing data from a study on intuitive eating in NCAA athletes. The analysis compares our Python-based statistical analysis with previous SPSS results. We need to verify the accuracy of our p-values and understand any discrepancies.

## Key Files
1. `scripts/statistical_analysis.py`: Contains our t-test and ANOVA implementations
2. `scripts/orchestrator.py`: Main script that runs the analysis
3. `oosterhouse_pvals.tsv`: Original SPSS p-values
4. `P-VALUE_COMPARISON.md`: Comparison of our results with SPSS
5. `data/data.tsv`: Raw data file
6. `data/variable_definitions.json`: Variable metadata and coding

## Statistical Methods Used
- Independent samples t-tests (scipy.stats.ttest_ind)
- One-way ANOVA (pingouin.ancova)
- Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction (statsmodels.stats.multitest.multipletests)

## Variables to Check
### Outcomes (Dependent Variables):
- SS1 avg (Intuitive Eating)
- SS2 avg (Eating for Physical Rather Than Emotional Reasons)
- SS3 avg (Reliance on Hunger and Satiety Cues)
- SS4 avg (Body-Food Choice Congruence)
- Total Score Avg

### Predictors (Independent Variables):
- Gender (Male=2, Female=1)
- History of eating disorder (Yes=1, No=2)
- Prior weight change recommendation (Yes=1, No=2)
- Weight-sensitive sport (Yes=1, No=2)
- Endurance sport (Yes=1, No=2)

## Task
Please verify:
1. Raw p-values match between our analysis and SPSS (within reasonable rounding)
2. FDR correction is properly applied across all tests
3. Effect sizes (Cohen's d, partial η²) are calculated correctly
4. Any systematic patterns in differences between our results and SPSS
5. Proper handling of:
   - Missing values
   - Equal vs unequal variance assumptions
   - Two-tailed vs one-tailed tests
   - Multiple comparison corrections

## Code Implementation Details
```python
# Key code from statistical_analysis.py
t_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(group1, group2, nan_policy='omit')
_, global_corrected_pvals, _, _ = multipletests(all_p_values, method='fdr_bh')
```

## Current Findings
1. Raw p-values closely match SPSS results
2. Two results significant in SPSS (p < 0.05):
   - Gender effect on SS1 avg (p = 0.045)
   - Eating disorder history on SS1 and SS3 (both p = 0.011)
3. No results remain significant after FDR correction

## Questions to Address
1. Are the minor differences in raw p-values within expected numerical precision variation?
2. Is our FDR correction too conservative?
3. Should we consider grouping tests differently for FDR correction?
4. Are there any implementation errors in our statistical procedures?
5. Should we consider alternative approaches to multiple comparison correction?

## Expected Output
Please provide:
1. Verification of p-value calculations
2. Explanation of any discrepancies
3. Recommendations for improving statistical accuracy
4. Suggestions for additional validation checks
5. Assessment of our multiple comparison correction approach
