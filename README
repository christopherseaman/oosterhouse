I have attached my data excel file and below is what I am looking for as far as data analysis:

- Evaluating for correlation between IES-3 score/sub-score averages and gender, history of eating disorder, history of being told to change weight, weight-sensitive sport, endurance sport (I am assuming these are all T-tests)
- Evaluating for correlation between IES-3 score/sub-score averages and school, year in school (I am assuming these are ANOVA)
- Average IES-3 score/sub-score
- Summary tables with this information
- Demographics table

My deadline to have this back is Friday 4/18 

Notes:
The IES-3 uses averages of scores (not composite scores), which are listed in the far-right columns of the document. Please use this for analysis, not composite scores.
A Key for how to interpret table is on the second sheet

If you need any other clarification at all don't hesitate to let me know! Thank you so much for your help.
